************* Module omsi.analysis.compound_stats.omsi_score_compounds
W:  4, 0: TODO  Add support for using centroided MSI data directly by removing 0's from the intensity and mz array (fixme)
W:  5, 0: TODO  We can further parallelize the callculations by splitting the compound list up as well (not just the spectra) (fixme)
W: 27, 0: FIXME Check that the group and required settings for parameters are set appropriately (fixme)
W: 34, 0: FIXME This is not in the config but should be read from the MS2 data if available (fixme)
W: 38, 0: FIXME make this false once we can read it from file (fixme)
W: 41, 0: FIXME This is not in the config file. Needed to compute the neutralized *mass* in Da of the parent molecule (fixme)
W:155, 0: FIXME  Get the precursor_mz from the MS2 data (fixme)
W:156, 0: FIXME  Is this an input or should we get this from file (fixme)
W:168, 0: TODO: Possible further optimization by reading only on self.mpi_root and then sending the list to all (fixme)
W:214, 0: TODO NEED to update since collect now returns a single list not a list of lists (fixme)
C: 30, 0: Wrong continued indentation.
