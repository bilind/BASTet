W:  5, 0: TODO  Add support for using centroided MSI data directly by removing 0's from the intensity and mz array (fixme)
W:  6, 0: TODO  We can further parallelize the callculations by splitting the compound list up as well (not just the spectra) (fixme)
W:139, 0: TODO: Possible further optimization by reading only on self.mpi_root and then sending the list to all (fixme)
W:201, 0: TODO NEED to update since collect now returns a single list not a list of lists (fixme)
